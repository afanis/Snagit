1.  WHAT IS SNAGIT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome! You have chosen a powerful Windows image, text, and video
  capture program that allows you many options. SnagIt is for any
  computer user who needs to capture more than a few screens for
  any purpose, such as:

  o  Capturing screens and menus in a Windows program to create
     documentation.

  o  Professional image processing and manipulation, e.g. shrink
     screen captures while maintaining image readability.

  o  Saving a long window, even if it scrolls off-screen, with a
     single capture instead of clipping them together.

  o  Creating AVI movies from live program action on your computer 
     screen.  Also record audio at the same time from your microphone.

  o  Creating a multimedia program or computer based training (CBT).

  o  Reducing the number of repetitious steps required to capture many
     screens.

  o  Saving a screen to e-mailing it to someone else.

  o  Capturing text from applications with no cut or paste option.

  o  Easy management of large numbers of captures of any type; images, 
     text or video.

  o  Integrating SnagIt/32's capture functionality into other
     applications through its Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) support.

  SnagIt has been providing Microsoft Windows users with an easy way
  to capture and print Windows screens since it was first released in
  1990.  In "Windows 3.1 Secrets," author Brian Livingston calls
  SnagIt "the print utility Microsoft Windows forgot."

1.1 What is the SnagIt Twin Pack?

  Many organizations are in the early stages of the transition from
  Windows 3.1x to Windows 98 or NT.  To assist during this period,
  TechSmith is offering the SnagIt Twin Pack.  It includes a 16-bit
  version, tailored for Windows 3.1x, as well as a true 32-bit version
  for Windows 95/98 and NT. The setup program automatically detects
  the workstation's operating environment and loads the appropriate
  version.  The purchaser is licensed to run either version and to
  switch between them without further payment. Purchasing the Twin
  Pack provides the benefits of running SnagIt today without the
  penalty of Windows 95 or NT upgrade fees in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  SNAGIT TWIN PACK SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  In order to run SnagIt, your system must meet these specifications:

  o  An IBM PC or compatible that meets the minimum hardware
     requirements for your version of Microsoft Windows.

  o  Microsoft Windows 3.1x, Windows For Workgroups 3.1x,
     Windows 4.0 (or higher), or Windows 95/98 installed and
     configured on your system.

  o  A mouse or other pointing device

  o  For printed output, a Windows-supported printer that can print
     bitmaps. (This includes most of the laser, dot matrix and ink jet
     printers that Windows supports.  Plotters are not recommended for
     use with SnagIt due to their inability to print bitmaps.)

4.3 Undocumented features

   Filters->Image Resolution: 
   This setting controls the resolution	of an image in dots per inch
   (dpi).  This parameter will control how other applications (e.g. 
   Microsoft Word) displays and prints images created by SnagIt. 
   SnagIt applies this resolution parameter to all image captures. 
   Unless you have need for a specific resolution, the Auto Configure 
   checkbox should be selected.  This option uses the default screen 
   resolution (typically 96 dpi).  In general, the higher the 
   resolution the smaller the images appear in publishing
   applications.
   
   Image->Resolution:   
   The image resolution can also be set for the single image being
   viewed in the Preview or Catalog viewer windows.  Changing the
   resolution here only affects the currently viewed image.
   
   Note: This setting does not affect how SnagIt displays or prints 
   the image.  This setting affects Image Capture mode only.

   The resolution property is not perserved by GIF or PNG files.

7. REGISTERING SNAGIT TWIN PACK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  This program and its associated files are part of an evaluation
  package copyrighted by TechSmith Corporation. SnagIt is not in the
  public domain.  This program must be registered if it is used
  beyond the 45 day evaluation period.

  Single-User SnagIt Twin Pack         $39.95

  Registration entitles the licensee to install either the 32 bit or
  the 16 bit version of SnagIt and to switch between the two without
  further payment.

  When you register SnagIt Twin Pack, you have the option of
  requesting a registered version of the software on CDROM or of
  requesting a software key to register the version you have. The
  software key immediately removes all registration reminder screens.

  Multi-User SnagIt Twin Pack         $200.00

  Registration entitles the licensed organization to install 10 copies
  of SnagIt, in any combination of 16 bit and 32 bit. A single
  CDROM is shipped along with the multi-user license.

  Registration Instructions

  1.  Select the SnagIt program's Help menu.

  2.  Select Register SnagIt from the menu.

  3.  Click on the Registration Form button.  Enter your registration
      information in the fields provided.

      NOTE: You must specify a name or company name when you register.
            Your software key will be personalized for that name ONLY.

  4.  When you are finished, select OK. This will create a text file
      called REGISTER.TXT in the SnagIt default directory. This is
      your registration and order form.  It includes a price sheet
      and your Product ID number.

  5.  Windows Notepad will now open REGISTER.TXT automatically,
      allowing you to edit and/or print the registration form.  While
      you are editing, please complete any blank items, including
      quantities, totals, and payment information. DO NOT EDIT THE
      PRODUCT ID NUMBER. Note that shipping charges are only
      applicable to CDROM orders.

  6.  Return the registration form, with payment, to TechSmith
      Corporation by any of the methods described on the form.  Upon
      receipt of your order, TechSmith will generate your CDROM or
      software key. It will then be sent to you by the method of
      your choice, either e-mail, fax, postal delivery or other.

  If you have elected to receive a software key, use the following
  steps to complete the registration process.

  7.  Select the Help->Register SnagIt menu item.

  8.  Click on the Enter Software Key button.

  9.  Enter your registration key, exactly as it is shown, in the
      field provided.
